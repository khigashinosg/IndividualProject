# IndividualProject

With more than 51,000 students, finding study space at UCL can be a challenge, resulting in lost study hours and a diminished student experience. 
In response to this issue, UCL has invested heavily in its Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure to gather valuable data on occupancy patterns. 
However, current data analysis applications are limited, only providing real-time occupancies of popular study areas. 
Therefore, to help students find optimal study spaces, an autonomous data analysis system was conceived, utilising historic data and machine learning to provide appropriate study space recommendations for both current and future use.

Primarily, this project revolves around how raw data from UCL’s three most popular areas (Main Library, Student Centre, and Science Library) is transformed into comprehensive information for students. 
To do so, multiple investigations were pursued, such as relative popularity, machine learning regression techniques, feature analysis, and data set size. 
These investigations allowed for a fully autonomous Python-coded system to be developed, capable of extrapolating historic occupancy trends and predictive machine learning. 

Additionally, infrastructure and mobile app concepts are provided to demonstrate the system’s feasibility for practical implementation. 
The infrastructure concept integrates existing IoT systems and additional cloud-computing services to support data collection, the analysis system, and the mobile app. 
In the mobile app concept, user-flow diagrams and concept art illustrate how results from the data analysis system can be presented in a student-friendly way.

Using UCL’s electronic turnstiles to collect data, the data analysis system was successful in extracting historic trends and predicting occupancies with as little as three weeks of training data. 
However, due to the Student Centre’s high popularity, its predictions are slightly less accurate in comparison to other areas, also requiring more training data to achieve minimum accuracy. 
Combined with the infrastructure and mobile concepts, this project highlights how occupancy data can be used to improve study space usage and enhance the UCL student experience.
